Where does our system stand right now?

\section{Outlook}
<<This is vague>>
This project is far from being completed. Creating a program that appears to successfully analyse meteor events is the most important building block for collecting data, but there is much more to do beyond that. Now that the script is set up, a substantial amount of events is needed to be collected with our own all-sky camera to be able make any reasonable conclusions about the near-Earth population. The data that needed to be collected is the photometric data of the events, but there is substantial statistical analysis that needs to be done to extrapolate that photometric data into meteor size. The future of this project is thus based on optimizing the data collected and performing data analysis on that data to justify drawing any reasonable conclusion from the collection of individual events.
