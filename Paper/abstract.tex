When  designing new satellites, incorporating damage mitigation techniques is currently difficult due to a lack of understanding about the near-Earth small asteroid population. In an effort to investigate this population, we have constructed a portable all-sky camera to continuously monitor the night sky. It has the capability to detect and then record meteors burning up in Earth's atmosphere. To begin to measure the number and size distribution of these small asteroids, this project focuses on writing software to automatically measure a meteor's brightness, calibrate it to a known astronomic luminosity and estimate its size.
