I would like to thank the following professors for writing me letter of recommendations and for their own respective contributions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dr. Jed Rembold for dealing with all my stupid questions regarding life and this thesis.

	\item Dr. Rick Watkins for being pretty dang funny.

	\item Dr. Daniel Borrero for forcing me in class to \textit{explain} code instead of just turning it in.

\end{itemize}
I would also like to thank the following people for being pretty swell and whatnot.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Future Dr. Adam Newton Wright for his contributions on our future Nobel Prize-winning discoveries

	\item Kelsey Walker for having optimism so bright it would immediately oversaturate our all-sky camera's sensors.

	\item Mark Watney for making all my problems seem pretty trivial.

	\item All the angels on Stack Overflow who spend their time answering obscure coding questions
\end{itemize}
