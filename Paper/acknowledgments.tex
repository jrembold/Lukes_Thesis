I would like to thank the following for their own respective contributions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dr. Jed Rembold for dealing with all my stupid questions regarding life and this thesis.

	\item Dr. Rick Watkins for showing me that space is pretty rad.

	\item Dr. Daniel Borrero for reminding me that \texttt{pile\_of\_illegible\_code !=} \\ \texttt{ satisfactory\_response}


	\item Future Dr. Adam Newton Wright for his contributions on our future Nobel Prize-winning discoveries

	\item Kelsey Walker for having optimism so bright it would immediately oversaturate our all-sky camera's sensors.

	\item Mark Watney for making all my problems seem pretty trivial.
\end{itemize}
