\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.4}{\ignorespaces All-sky cameras feature a 360$^{\circ }$ view of the horizon, providing maximum sky coverage. This is an image from a high resolution color camera \cite {Alcor}.}}{8}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.5}{\ignorespaces The all-sky camera can see distance $z$. The area of the Earth it covers are between the points that have the endpoints of $z$ as their zeniths along height $h$. Note that the height of the atmosphere where ablation occurs is often less than 100 kilometers, while the radius of the Earth is 6,371 kilometers, so the radii are not to scale.}}{9}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.7}{\ignorespaces This network manages to cover a lot of area, but it may not have the best observational quality due to the cameras being centered in cities \cite {SkySentinel}.}}{10}
