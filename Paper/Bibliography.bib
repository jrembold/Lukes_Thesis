abstract = {Video observations of lunar impact flashes have been made by a number of researchers since the late 1990's and the problem of determination of the impact energies has been approached in different ways Bellot Rubio et al. (2000a, b), Yanagisawa et al. (2008), Bouley et al. (2012), Suggs et al. (2014), Rembold and Ryan (2015), Ortiz et al. (2015), Madiedo et al. (2015). The wide spectral response of the unfiltered video cameras in use for all published measurements necessitates color correction for the standard filter magnitudes available for the comparison stars but this is not typically considered. In our approach, the published color of the comparison star and an estimate of the color of the impact flash is used to correct it to the chosen filter bandpass. Magnitudes corrected to standard filters are then used to determine the luminous energy in the filter bandpass according to the stellar atmosphere calibrations of Bessell et al. (1998). In this paper we compare the various photometric calibration techniques and calculation of luminous energy (radiometry) of impact flashes. This issue has significant implications for determination of luminous efficiency, predictions of impact crater sizes for observed flashes, and the determination of the flux of meteoroids in the 10 s of grams to kilograms mass range.},

abstract = {The flashes from meteoroid impacts on the Moon are useful in determining the flux of impactors with masses as low as a few tens of grams. A routine monitoring program at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center has recorded over 300 impacts since 2006. A selection of 126 flashes recorded during periods of photometric skies was analyzed, creating the largest and most homogeneous dataset of lunar impact flashes to date. Standard CCD photometric techniques were applied to the video and the luminous energy, kinetic energy, and mass are estimated for each impactor. Shower associations were determined for most of the impactors and a range of luminous efficiencies was considered. The flux to a limiting energy of 2.5×10-6kT TNT or 1.05×107J is 1.03×10-7km-2h-1 and the flux to a limiting mass of 30g is 6.14×10-10m-2yr-1 at the Moon. Comparisons made with measurements and models of the meteoroid population indicate that the flux of objects in this size range is slightly lower (but within the error bars) than flux at this size from the power law distribution determined for the near Earth object and fireball population by Brown et al. (Brown, P.G., Spalding, R., ReVelle, D., Tagliaferri, E., Worden, S. [2002]. Nature 420, 294-296).

Here we investigate the 4/1, 3/1, 5/2, and 7/3 commensurabilities and show that, due to the interaction between the v5 and v6 secular resonances, chaotic motion is present almost everywhere in the phase space. This chaotic motion is responsible for the large jumps in the eccentricity (up to 0.8 or more) that one usually observes in the realistic numerical simulations, which force the asteroids to cross the orbits not only of Mars, but even of Earth. In this way we achieve a better understanding of the effective mechanisms for the depletion of the 3/1, 5/2, and 4/1 resonances, and we are able to explain, for the first time, the existence of the gap associated with the 7/3 mean motion commensurability.},

abstract = {Abstract The Yarkovsky and YORP (Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack) effects are thermal radiation forces and torques that cause small objects to undergo semimajor axis drift and spin vector modifications, respectively, as a function of their spin, orbit, and material properties. These mechanisms help to (a) deliver asteroids (and meteoroids) with diameter D {\textless} 40 km from their source locations in the main belt to chaotic resonance zones capable of transporting this material to Earth-crossing orbits; (b) disperse asteroid families, with drifting bodies jumping or becoming trapped in mean-motion and secular resonances within the main belt; (c) modify the rotation rates and obliquities of D {\textless} 40 km asteroids; and (d) allow asteroids to enter into spin-orbit resonances, which affect the evolution of their spin vectors and feedback into the Yarkovsky-driven semimajor axis evolution. Accordingly, we suggest that nongravitational forces should now be considered as important as collisions and gravitational perturbations to our overall understanding of asteroid evolution.},

abstract = {Asteroid events such as the air blast above Chelyabinsk, Russia, in the spring of 2013 have highlighted the importance of understanding Earth's local asteroid population and the potential threat they pose. While much observational data exists for larger asteroids (those greater than 50 meters in diameter), comparatively little is known of the very small meteoroid population. This study utilized the non-illuminated part of the near side of the Moon as a detection screen upon which the faint flashes of small meteoroids hitting the lunar surface could be detected. Over 80 hours of observations were conducted between the fall of 2010 and the spring of 2013. The observed lunar area was determined nightly and used alongside the impact count to determine a meteoroid flux rate. Impact flashes were calibrated to extinction and color corrected reference stars to estimate the kinetic energies involved. Analysis indicated an average flux rate of 1.09??10-7km-2h-1, corresponding to 1 impactor larger than 3 centimeters in diameter observed every 30 minutes. Further, the size distribution dependence of small impactors was found to be consistent with the power law governing the larger-size meteoroid distribution. This data helps fix the low-end of the asteroid size distribution for solar system evolution models.},

abstract = {First results are presented from a newly developed meteoroid orbit survey, called CAMS – Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance, which combines meteor detection algorithms for low-light video observations with traditional video surveillance tools. Sixty video cameras at three stations monitor the sky above 31° elevation. Goal of CAMS is to verify meteor showers in search of their parent comets among newly discovered near-Earth objects. This paper outlines the concept of operations, the hardware, and software methods used during operation and in the data reduction pipeline, and accompanies the data release of the first batch of meteoroid orbits. During the month of November 2010, 2169 precisely reduced meteoroid trajectories from 17 nights have an error in the apparent radiant of the trajectory {\textless}2° and error in speed {\textless}10{\%}. Median values of the error are 0.31° and 0.53km/s, respectively, sufficient to resolve the intrinsic dispersion of annual meteor showers and resolve minor showers from the sporadic background. The limiting visual magnitude of the cameras is +5.4, recording meteors of +4 magnitude and brighter, bright enough to stand out from the mostly fainter sporadic meteors detected as under dense radar echoes. CAMS readily detected all established showers (6) active during the clear nights in November. Of the showers that needed confirmation, we confirm the theta Aurigids (THA, IAU{\#}390), the chi Taurids (CTA, IAU{\#}388), and the omicron Eridanids (OER, IAU{\#}338). We conclude that the iota November Aurigids (IAR, IAU{\#}248) are in fact the combined activity of the theta Aurigids and chi Taurids, and this shower should be dismissed from the list. Finally, there is also a clustering consistent with the zeta Cancrids (ZCN, IAU{\#}243), but we cannot exclude that this is lower perihelion dust belonging to the Orionid shower. Data are submitted to the IAU Meteor Data Center on a semi-regular basis, and can be accessed also at http://cams.seti.org.},

abstract = {A very bright fireball called B{\'{e}}jar (SPMN110708), with a maximum brightness of -18, was observed over much of Spain as well as parts of Portugal and France on 2008 July 11 at 21:17:39 UTC. Fortuitously, it flew over many of the instruments that are part of the Spanish Meteor and Fireball Network so that accurate measurements of its properties were recorded. We describe these observations and make deductions from them regarding the nature and origin of the body that gave rise to this fireball. The bolide first became visible at a height of 98.3 km, attained its maximum brightness at a height of 26 km and finished at a height of 21.5 km. These values are very much in line with other well-known fireballs producing meteorites. Standard calculations based on the meteoroids' ability to survive in the atmosphere suggest a strength for the remnant that survived to this height of about 14 MPa, similar to those for meteorite-dropping bolides. So far, this fireball looks typical and one might well expect to find meteorites on the ground in due course. The heliocentric orbit of the meteoroid determined from the observations had a perihelion essentially at the Earth's orbit and an eccentricity of 0.775, so that the orbit extends far beyond Jupiter, nearly reaching Saturn's heliocentric distance and is a typical orbit for a member of the Jupiter family of comets. This is unlike other bright fireballs, where aphelion is within the asteroidal belt and clearly points to an asteroidal origin. The orbit is also very similar to the mean orbit of the Omicron Draconid meteor shower, which is an additional pointer to this fireball being of cometary origin. If the parent was indeed a comet, this has implications for the internal structure of comets in that significant-sized non-icy inclusions must exist there. This is not surprising, but this is probably the first time that direct evidence has been found showing that this is the case. Further, such chunks can only be released through the catastrophic breakup of the nucleus. Remarkably, a candidate for the parent of the Omicron Draconid meteor shower is comet C/1919 Q2 (Metcalf) which suffered a catastrophic breakup in the early decades of the last century.},

abstract = {By using high-resolution low-scan-rate all-sky CCD cameras, the SPanish Meteor Network (SPMN) detected an outburst of Orionid meteors associated with comet 1P/Halley on 2006 October 20-21. This detection was made possible due to the operational concept of the SPMN that involves continuous monitoring of meteor activity throughout the year. Accurate heliocentric orbits have been obtained for three meteors imaged simultaneously from two stations during the outburst. Additional astrometry of 33 single-station meteors indicates that the activity was produced from a conspicuous geocentric radiant located at $\alpha$ = 922 +/- 05 and $\delta$ = +154 +/- 06 which is similar to the radiant observed during the 1993 Orionid outburst despite the fact that the last one peaked on a different date. The radiant position obtained by the SPMN is consistent with that derived from digital pictures taken a few hours before from Ankara (Turkey). The extent of the outburst (a background of bright meteors was observed over several days), its absence in other years, and the orbital period of the three Orionid orbits suggest that the outburst could be produced by meteoroids trapped in resonances with Jupiter but additional data are required. The SPMN's continuous coverage of meteor activity allowed the identification of the main sources of meteors during 2006 October: mostly due to the Orionid stream, the two branches of the Taurid stream associated with comet 2P/Encke, and the $\delta$ Aurigids. Surprisingly, once a detailed analysis of the double-station video meteors was completed, some additional minor stream activity was discovered, that is, the $\nu$ Aurigids. In consequence, we also present two accurate orbits of this unexpected, but previously identified, minor shower.},

abstract = {Asteroids with diameters smaller than approximately 50-100 m that collide with the Earth usually do not hit the ground as a single body; rather, they detonate in the atmosphere. These small objects can still cause considerable damage, such as occurred near Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908. The flux of small bodies is poorly constrained, however, in part because ground-based observational searches pursue strategies that lead them preferentially to find larger objects. A Tunguska-class event-the energy of which we take to be equivalent to 10 megatons of TNT-was previously estimated to occur every 200-300 years, with the largest annual airburst calculated to be approximately 20 kilotons (kton) TNT equivalent (ref. 4). Here we report satellite records of bolide detonations in the atmosphere over the past 8.5 years. We find that the flux of objects in the 1-10-m size range has the same power-law distribution as bodies with diameters {\textgreater}50 m. From this we estimate that the Earth is hit on average annually by an object with approximately 5 kton equivalent energy, and that Tunguska-like events occur about once every 1,000 years.},

We present plots and equations for the flux, as a function of initial mass, for the entire group of fireballs and for some subgroups: meteorite-dropping objects; meteor shower members; groups that appear to be mainly of asteroidal or cometary origin; and for very fast objects. For masses of a few kilograms, asteroidal objects outnumber cometary ones. Cometary objects attain greater peak brightness than asteroidal ones of equal mass largely due to higher velocity, but also because they fragment more severely. For 66 fireballs, we estimate the meteoroid density using photometric and dynamic masses. Presumed cometary objects have typical densities near 1.0, while asteroidal values show two groups that suggest meteoroids similar to carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites. Our basic data may be used by others for further studies or to reexamine our results using assumptions different from those employed in this paper.},

@article{Steel1996,
abstract = {Numerically-speaking, the orbits of meteoroids dominate our knowledge of the orbital parameters of Earth-crossing small bodies: the meteoroid orbit database outstrips the numbers of observed Earth-crossing asteroids and comets by over two orders of magnitude. Whilst it is often imagined that small meteoroids are predominantly derived from comets through stream formation, and thus must have comet-like orbits, in fact the majority of observed meteoroid orbits are more similar to those of Apollo and Aten asteroids, with small, low-inclination orbits. In all about 69 000 meteoroid orbits are available from the IAU Meteor Data Center in Lund, Sweden, having been measured in various optical and radar observation programs based in the U.S.A., Canada, the former Soviet Union, Somalia, the Czech Republic, Japan, and Australia. Depending upon the detection method used, the original meteoroids producing the observed meteoric phenomena range in size from ˜100 $\mu$m to ˜10 cm. Here the raw orbital, radiant and speed distributions are presented for the major surveys, a common format being used so that they may be intercompared such that general conclusions may be drawn, and the differences between the survey results identified. These data, collected over the past several decades, provide an important source of information on the origin and evolution of the small bodies in the solar system.},
